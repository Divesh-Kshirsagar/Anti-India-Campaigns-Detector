#### 4. Response Enablement
**Objective**: Provide security agencies with actionable intelligence and decision support tools for timely intervention and countermeasures.

**Key Results**:
- Deliver comprehensive threat reports within 2 hours of detection
- Provide evidence packages suitable for legal proceedings
- Enable predictive analysis for campaign trajectory forecasting
- Support coordination between multiple security agencies

**Success Metrics**:
- **Response Time**: Time from detection to actionable intelligence delivery
- **Evidence Quality**: Percentage of reports leading to successful interventions
- **Inter-agency Adoption**: Number of agencies actively using system outputs
