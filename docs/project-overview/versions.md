## Development Guidelines
1. **Data Collection Focus**: Each version focuses on collecting raw data without processing
2. **Simple UI**: tkinter-based interface for simplicity and ease of deployment
3. **Modular Design**: Each platform integration is modular and can be enabled/disabled
4. **Configuration Management**: All API keys and settings managed through config files
5. **Data Export**: Consistent data export formats across all platforms
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout all modules

## Notes
- No FastAPI or Streamlit dependencies as per project requirements
- Processing and analysis components are excluded and will be handled separately
- Focus on reliable data collection and user-friendly interface
- Each version builds upon the previous version's functionality
