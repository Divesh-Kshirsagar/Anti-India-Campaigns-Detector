![System Logo](assets/logo.png){ width="200" }

## Overview

The **Anti-India Campaign Detection System** is a comprehensive intelligence-gathering and analysis platform designed to identify, monitor, and analyze hostile narratives targeting India on digital platforms. This system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), multi-layered intelligence strategies, and real-time monitoring to provide actionable intelligence to security agencies.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance across Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter
- **Automated Account Operations**: Real account automation for accessing restricted content
- **Multi-Intelligence Approach**: Combines SIGINT, HUMINT, and OSINT capabilities
- **Advanced NLP**: Sentiment analysis and contextual filtering to reduce false positives
- **Interactive GUI**: tkinter-based desktop application for data collection and monitoring
- **Cross-Platform HUMINT**: Advanced capabilities for accessing private communities across platforms
- **Crowdsourced Intelligence**: Multi-platform tipline for community-driven intelligence gathering

## üéØ Mission Statement

To provide security agencies with a robust, intelligent, and adaptable system for early detection and analysis of anti-India campaigns, enabling timely and informed preventive actions against digital threats to national security.
