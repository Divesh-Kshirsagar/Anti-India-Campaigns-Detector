## Overview

The **Anti-India Campaign Detection System** is a comprehensive intelligence-gathering and analysis platform designed to identify, monitor, and analyze hostile narratives targeting India on digital platforms. This system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), multi-layered intelligence strategies, and real-time monitoring to provide actionable intelligence to security agencies.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of public Telegram channels
- **Multi-Intelligence Approach**: Combines SIGINT, HUMINT, and OSINT capabilities
- **Advanced NLP**: Sentiment analysis and contextual filtering to reduce false positives
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based visualization for real-time threat assessment
- **Honeypot Integration**: Advanced HUMINT capabilities for accessing private communities
- **Crowdsourced Intelligence**: Public tipline for community-driven intelligence gathering

## üéØ Mission Statement

To provide security agencies with a robust, intelligent, and adaptable system for early detection and analysis of anti-India campaigns, enabling timely and informed preventive actions against digital threats to national security.
